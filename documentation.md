The task is to search for open source LLMs that make good performance in the code coverage task then try to test it on colab. 
The LLMs that I faced was Starcoder, CodeGen , MOSA , Codex ( found out it is not open source ) ,
beside list of other models that was not said directly to be used on code coverage problems but used generally on code generation tasks like codeLlama for instance.
All those model has no interface on hugging face and could not either run on colab or run on local as they are too large to run on RAM.
The next step is to buy some server and run try using models on it. I will leave some links of the targeted models to reach it easily.
